# Unit Testing Practice â€“ NOVI Backend Java Assignment

## About the Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Unit Testing** assignment from lesson 6 of the Backend Java module at [Novi University](https://www.novi.nl).

The focus of this assignment is to practice writing **JUnit tests** for simple Java classes like `Person` and `Calculator`. These tests help ensure that classes behave correctly when accessed via **getters**, **setters**, and custom logic methods.

## Tech Stack

- **IntelliJ IDEA**
- **Java 17+**
- **JUnit 5** for testing
- **Maven** for build and test execution

## Key Features

### `Calculator` Class Tests

- `canSumNormalInt`  
  Tests that two positive integers are summed correctly.

- `canSumNegativeInt`  
  Verifies that adding negative integers returns the correct result.

### `Person` Class Tests

- `canCreatePerson`  
  Confirms that a `Person` instance is created with the correct properties.

- tests for getters and setters like:
  `canGetName`  
  Checks whether the getter returns the correct name value.

  `canSetName`  
  Ensures the setter updates the name property properly.

## How to Run Tests

1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Right-click on the `test` folder or any individual test class.
3. Choose **Run 'All Tests'** or **Run 'CalculatorTest'**, etc.
   or
   Open a terminal in the root of the project and run:

```bash
./mvnw test
```
